# About Nebula Financial

## Our Mission
To democratize finance by building the bridge between traditional banking and the decentralized future. We believe that financial freedom should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, instantly.

## Who We Are
Nebula Financial is a Series C fintech scale-up based in London and New York. We started in 2021 with a simple goal: make cross-border payments as easy as sending a text message. Today, we process over $2B in monthly volume and serve 3 million customers worldwide.

## Our Products

### Nebula Wallet
Our flagship mobile application that allows users to store, send, and swap both fiat and crypto assets with zero fees. It features built-in high-yield savings accounts powered by DeFi protocols, abstracted away behind a simple, banking-grade UI.

### Flux Exchange
Our institutional-grade matching engine for high-frequency trading. Flux handles over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) and provides liquidity to our consumer wallet and B2B partners.

## Our Values

### 1. Trust is Currency
In finance, trust is everything. We prioritize security, compliance, and transparency above all else. We don't take shortcuts with user funds.

### 2. Velocity with Precision
We move fast, but we don't break things. We believe in rigorous automation, testing, and observability to enable high-velocity interactions without compromising stability.

### 3. Owners, Not Renters
Every engineer is an owner of their code, their product, and the company. We operate with a "You Build It, You Run It" mentality.
