# Interview Feedback: Dr. Sofia Al-Fayed
**Role**: Senior Machine Learning Engineer
**Date**: Nov 15, 2025
**Interviewer**: Mark Chen and Prof. Elena Rossini

## Summary
Sofia is a unicorn in terms of theory. She understands the math better than anyone on the Platform team. However, she is a complete novice when it comes to software engineering. She treats code as a disposable tool to get a plot, not as a product.

## Competency Scores

| Competency | Score | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Deep Learning Theory** | 5/5 | World-class. Her paper on Equivariant GNNs is brilliant. |
| **Python Programming** | 3/5 | Can write complex logic, but structure is messy (giant scripts, global variables). |
| **MLOps / Infrastructure** | 1/5 | Non-existent. Does not know Docker, CI/CD, or Unit Testing. |
| **Communication** | 4/5 | Explains complex math clearly. |

## Recommendation
**HIRE (Conditional)**.
We cannot find this level of theoretical understanding easily.
HOWEVER, she is **NOT** a "Senior Engineer" in the traditional sense.
We should hire her but put her on an intensive "Software Engineering Boot Camp" for the first 3 months. If we don't fix her engineering habits, she will create technical debt that will bury us.
