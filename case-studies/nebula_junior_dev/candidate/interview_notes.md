# Interview Feedback: Jordan Lee
**Role**: Senior Backend Engineer
**Date**: Oct 24, 2025
**Interviewer**: Sarah Strong

## Summary
Jordan is a very strong coder with deep knowledge of traditional backend systems (databases, algorithms, optimization). However, there is a significant gap in modern cloud-native practices. He fits the "Senior" title for coding capability but is "Junior" regarding our specific infrastructure stack (K8s, Distributed Systems).

## Competency Scores (1-5)

| Competency | Score | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Coding & Algorithms** | 5/5 | Excellent. Optimized O(n) solution. Clean code. |
| **System Design** | 3/5 | Good with vertical scaling/SQL. Weak on distributed patterns (CAP, eventual consistency). |
| **Infrastructure / Ops** | 1/5 | No K8s experience. Relies on Ops teams. "Throw it over the wall" mentality (old habit). |
| **Communication** | 4/5 | Clear, articulate, honest about knowledge gaps. |

## Recommendation
**HIRE**.
Rationale: The "Cloud Native" gap is teachable. His fundamental engineering skills are hard to find. We need to put him on a rigorous onboarding track to get him up to speed with Kubernetes, Terraform, and Distributed Locking patterns within the first 90 days.
